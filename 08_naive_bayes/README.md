# Naive Bayes - Spam Detection

## 📖 Overview
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.

## 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Bayes' Theorem**: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
- **Naive Assumption**: Features are independent
- **Types**: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli
- **Prior & Posterior Probabilities**

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
