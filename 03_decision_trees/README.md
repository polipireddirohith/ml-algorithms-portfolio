# Decision Trees - Iris Classification

## 📖 Overview

Decision Trees are versatile supervised learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression. This project demonstrates multi-class classification on the famous Iris dataset.

## 🎯 Algorithm Explanation

**Decision Trees** create a tree-like model of decisions based on feature values:

- **Root Node**: Entire dataset
- **Internal Nodes**: Decision based on features
- **Leaf Nodes**: Final prediction
- **Branches**: Outcome of a decision

## 🔑 Key Concepts

1. **Splitting Criteria**: Gini Impurity, Entropy, Information Gain
2. **Tree Depth**: Controls model complexity
3. **Pruning**: Prevents overfitting
4. **Feature Importance**: Based on split quality

## 📊 Dataset

- **Features**: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- **Target**: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- **Size**: 150 samples (classic dataset)
