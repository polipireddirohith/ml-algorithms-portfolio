# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Digit Recognition

## 📖 Overview
KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies based on the K nearest training examples.

## 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan
- **K Selection**: Odd numbers to avoid ties
- **Lazy Learning**: No training phase
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Performance degrades with high dimensions

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 💡 Applications
Pattern recognition, recommendation systems, anomaly detection
